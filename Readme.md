# Justin Bento's Odin Project Journey. 

Welcome to my personal repository, where I document and store my projects connected to The Odin Project. As I dive into this educational journey, this repository becomes a record of what I'm learning and accomplishing. It's a tool for tracking my growth and reflecting on the exciting path I've taken with The Odin Project.

I chose this path to brush up on the fundamentals of website development and transform into a skilled software developer, moving beyond just being a designer. Additionally, this project-based learning has greatly boosted my confidence in programming and various aspects of learning.

While currently anticipating a break, let me provide a succinct overview of my website development timeline:

## Understanding Learning Journey Timeline

I began learning about website design and development in 2019. At first, I was interested in programming, but I found out it wouldn't be used that year.

Later on, in 2021, I switched to a new program called Multimedia Design and Development. This program focused more on the basics of design. Although it was interesting, I realized that I don't always enjoy being creative because it can be tiring.

In my free time, I revisited Website Development, seeking good, free resources. That's where I discovered The Odin Project.

### Started The Odin Project: 2021 - 2022

After I finished school, I realized that my coding skills weren't as good as many other programmers at that time. I attempted to join coding boot camps, but I didn't get accepted into the ones I preferred. That's when I recognized that my understanding of software development was much weaker compared to others.

### **Re-Started The Odin Project Foundations:** May 2023

I decided to restart my journey in website development from scratch. This time around, I set a rule for myself: jot down essential information I missed before to build a stronger foundation. Since then, I've stuck with this approach, and it has significantly boosted my confidence in using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Although my JavaScript skills were a bit shaky, I started working on personal and client projects to enhance them. After completing The Odin Project Foundations on September 26th, 2023, I landed a job in website development and received positive feedback. Taking a moment to reflect, I chose to delve into Ruby on Rails in November 2023, inspired by a Ruby conference in Toronto. The welcoming community motivated me, and I see Ruby as my go-to language for future automation projects.

Thanks for reading about my background into website design and development. 

Here are some steps to install this repository:

## Installation

First, I open up my terminal and go to the main directory using the command "cd" and then press enter.
````
cd
````
After that, I create a parent directory named "development."
````
mkdir ~/development/
````
Once the folder is created, I enter into it. This folder will hold all of my development-related projects, keeping everything organized in one place instead of scattered throughout my system.
````
cd development
````
Now, within this main development folder, I've listed all the resources I used to set up my developer environment. I often refer to these resources whenever I set up my machine, ensuring a consistent experience across different devices, from my home computer to my work laptop.

- Setting up Git with GitHub: [https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-setting-up-git](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-setting-up-git)
