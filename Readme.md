<h1>My Odin Project Journey</h1>

<p>Welcome to my personal repository, where I'll be documenting and storing my projects related to The Odin Project. This is where I'll chronicle my coding journey, and share my progress, and showcase the projects I create along the way. </p>
<p>As I embark on this educational adventure, this repository will serve as a record of my learning experiences and accomplishments. Allowing me to track my growth and reflect on the exciting path I've chosen with The Odin Project.</p>

<em> Disclaimer: I studied Website Design and Development in college. My goal in taking this course was to reteach myself the fundamentals of becoming a website developer rather than a website designer. As i started to prefer development over design as it was less abstract and very straightforward.</em>

<h2>Odin Project Time Line</h2>
<p>Foundations Course: January 2023 - March 2023</p>
<p>Started Full Stack JavaScript: June 2023 - Ongoing</p>
