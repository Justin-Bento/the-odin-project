<h1>My Odin Project Journey</h1>

<p>Welcome to my personal repository, where I'll be documenting and storing my projects related to The Odin Project. This is where I'll chronicle my coding journey, and share my progress, and showcase the projects I create along the way. </p>
<p>As I embark on this educational adventure, this repository will serve as a record of my learning experiences and accomplishments. Allowing me to track my growth and reflect on the exciting path I've chosen with The Odin Project.</p>

<em> Disclaimer: I studied Website Design and Development in college. My goal in taking this course was to reteach myself the fundamentals of becoming a website developer rather than a website designer. As i started to prefer development over design as it was less abstract and very straightforward.</em>

<h2>Odin Project Time Line</h2>

Now that you’ve had plenty of practice using Grid, we are going to build a full dashboard design. For this project, use whatever tools you need to get it done, but try to lean on Grid for the majority of the layout work. Go back through the lessons or practice assignments if you need a refresher.
