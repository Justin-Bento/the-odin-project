# The Odin Project — Monorepo

This repository contains all projects completed as part of The Odin Project curriculum.

The goal of this monorepo is to strengthen my JavaScript and frontend engineering skills, complementing my background in UI/UX and visual design.

Each project is independently buildable and deployable, and many are accessible via a dedicated subdomain on my personal website.
