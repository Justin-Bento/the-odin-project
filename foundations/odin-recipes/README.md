# Project: Recipes

The project started on 2023-12-09 and finished on the same day.

This is the first project within The Odin Project foundation course. My goal was to practice all of the HTML knowledge I have acquired. In this project, you are going to build a basic recipe website. Its goal is to consist of a main index page that will have links to a few recipes. The website won’t look very pretty by the time you’ve finished.

Technologies used in this website are HTML and Vercel (Deployment).

Everything was good, but the snag I faced during this project was setting up URLs to link media, images, and CSS and JavaScript files together within this folder structure. I fixed the links to resemble `/foundations/odin-recipes/filename.type` instead of `/filename.type`. Once that was fixed, it was smooth sailing.
