# Project: Recipes

This is the first project within The Odin Project foundation course. My goal was to practice all of the HTML knowledge you have acquired. In this project, you are going to build a basic recipe website. It goal is to consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes. The website won’t look very pretty by the time you’ve finished.
