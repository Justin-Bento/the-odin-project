    <h1>Juicy Roasted Chicken</h1>
    <p>
      This roasted chicken is perfectly seasoned and just like the way my
      grandmother used to make it. The method used in this recipe results in the
      juiciest chicken! We loved to nibble on the celery after it was cooked.

      <p>Roasted chicken never fails to impress, but it's surprisingly simple to make! This juicy roasted chicken recipe is perfect for beginner cooks and old pros alike.</p>
      <h2>How to Roast a Chicken</h2>
      <p>Roasting a whole chicken at home is easier than it seems. You'll find a detailed ingredient list and step-by-step instructions in the recipe below, but let's go over the basics:</p>
      <div class="">
        <h2>Roasted Chicken Ingredients</h2>
        <p>These are the ingredients you'll need to make the juiciest roast chicken recipe of your life:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Chicken:</strong> This recipe starts with a 3-pound whole chicken. If your bird is larger or smaller, you'll need to adjust the recipe.</li>
          <li><strong>Seasonings:</strong> This roasted chicken is simply seasoned with salt, black pepper, and onion powder.</li>
          <li><strong>Butter:</strong> Butter locks in moisture and gives the seasonings something to adhere to.</li>
          <li><strong>Celery:</strong> Stuff the chicken cavity with celery for subtle vegetal flavor. Plus, the celery will release even more moisture as the chicken cooks.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="">
        <h2>How to Roast a Chicken Step-By-Step</h2>
        <p>Here's a very brief overview of what you can expect when you make homemade roasted chicken:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Season the chicken inside and out.</li>
          <li>Add the butter to the chicken and the pan.</li>
          <li>Stuff the cafity with celery.</li>
          <li>Bake until the chicken is fully roasted.</li>
        </ol>
      </div>
      <div class="">
        <h2>How Long to Roast a Chicken</h2>
        <p>In an oven preheated to 350 degrees F, a 3-pound whole chicken should be completely cooked in a little more than an hour. You'll know it's done when the meat is no longer pink at the bone, the juices run clear, and an instant read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh (near the bone) reads 165 degrees F.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="">
        <h2>Roasted Chicken Tips</h2>
        <p>"Roasting a whole chicken at home requires almost no effort and very few ingredients," says culinary producer Nicole McLaughlin (a.k.a. NicoleMcMom). Here are a few of her favorite tips for perfect roasted chicken every time:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The most important thing to know, according to Nicole: "Dry skin is crispy skin." Make sure you get the skin nice and dry with a paper towel before you season the chicken.</li>
          <li>"Don't forget to season the inside as well as the outside," says Nicole, who recommends also getting under the skin with butter for extra flavor.</li>
          <li>If you don't have a roasting pan, that's totally fine. Nicole prefers using a simple baking sheet with a rack on top.</li>
          <li>To prevent the wings from burning during the long roasting process, Nicole tucks them under the bird before sticking the chicken in the oven.</li>
        </ul>
