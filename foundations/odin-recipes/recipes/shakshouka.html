    <h1>Shakshuka (chakchouka or shakshouka)</h1>
    <p>
      This best mashed potato recipe is often requested during Thanksgiving.
      It's totally tasty, and everyone will rave! For a variation, spread in a
      casserole dish and refrigerate overnight; the next day, sprinkle with
      extra Parmesan cheese and butter and reheat in the oven.
