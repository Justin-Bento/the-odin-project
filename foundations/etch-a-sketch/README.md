#  Project: Etch-a-Sketch

Build A browser version of an Etch-A-Sketch where you can draw a with your mouse, change colors, and erase the drawing when you're done.

**What Does This Application Do?**

Etch a sketch application uses your mouse as a pen inside the browser.  So when your mouse passes over the sketchpad, it will leave a black  pixelated trail. What makes mine different is that you can change the default color to any color. To do this, first go underneath the sketchpad, you should see black box. Click that black box at the bottom and play around with the popup by adjusting the colour to your desire. Be sure to click okay at the end to submit the changes. After that you have another button called rainbow mode. this changes the colours `HSL` value, leaving a rainbow like trail behind your mouse.

**Why Did I Use the HTML, CSS & JavaScript Only?**

As I am re-doing the fundamentals course inside the Odin Project. I wanted to treat this project within the frame and mindset of a complete beginner, and use the technologies The Odin Project suggest. 

Doing this allowed me to do two things. The first things was further develop my understanding of the JavaScript DOM. The second thing was to help me see if I understand vanilla JavaScript

While using the JavaScript DOM, I managed to input all HTML elements, and make a basic layout with CSS. When it came to  the logic, I forgot a ton of basic JavaScript features. So I'm glad I came back and did this again as it helps solidify my knowledge.

**Some of the challenges you faced!**

1. Semantic HTML vs Non-Semantic HTML. When starting out I only used divs, after I came back from my weekend break. I was confused and decided to remove the sketchpad div as the parent, as nesting the application HTML code difficult to read inside the console. After removing it I replace the sketchpad element with a main body element, and also replaced other divs to a header and footer HTML element, doing this helped me break down each section of the webpage and made scanning my code easier for me..

2. Forgetting about features in JavaScript like nesting event listeners. After being on break for a month, I completely forgot about addEventListeners, and styling inside JavaScript. So, pseudo coding became my best friend as well as google. Google helped me understand core JavaScript elements and I learned things a lot faster. Going forward I am going comment my code more and save a template for all the tools I use, so I can just dive in without worry about setting up your environment.


3. Code Clarity. At first while my code is working I now understand why it is isnâ€™t necessarily good code. As my code very early on was difficult to read, understand, and modify. Naming Convention became very difficult for me as I did not fully understand the code at this time. So going forward I will be learning more about the code through commenting, and optimizing my code, to eventually become clear and legible.

**Features I Hope To Implement In The Future.**

*  Chaning grid size based on user input.

* Dark mode theme based on the userse system prefrences.

* Implement a progressive darkening effect where each interaction adds 10% more black or color to the square. The objective is to achieve a completely black square only after ten interactions.
