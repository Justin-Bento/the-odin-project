# Project Calculator

Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Justin Bento, a passionate software developer learning Full Stack JavaScript from Toronto Canada. Currently, I am taking the Fundamentals class inside The Odin Project to solidify my foundations. So I would like to remind people that this work is learning and enjoyment. Now let's get onto the project:

**Project Overview:**

Build a digital calculator that preforms basic math operations with numbers. This calculator utilizes HTML, CSS and JavaScript only and GitHub Pages for deployment. My goal is to use all the knowledge from the foundations course, and put it to the test buy building this calculator.

Challanges I Expect To Face: 
* Learning how to break down complex math figures and ensuring they're accurate.
* Effectily implimenting good coding practces with objects functions and loops.
* Commiting my code effecively so I can stay up to speed with the project.

Features I hope to implement in the future:
* Optimizing the calulation for floats (whole numbers) and ints(decimals) numbers accurately like a calulator.
* Impliment typing to the calulator so the user can use keyboard instead of clicking buttons.
* Replace system popups and alerts with modals to be less jaring.
* Including a system wide dark mode that updates based off the system prefrences.
