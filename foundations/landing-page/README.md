# Project: Landing Page

**Project Start Date:** Monday, 11th December 2023.  
**Project End Date:** [Specify end date].

In this project, I will be recreating an entire web page based on a design provided by The Odin Project.

My steps inside this project revolved around:

* Setting up my GitHub repository and cloning it onto my system.
* Downloading, transferring, and structuring assets for the main project.
* Breaking down the HTML to best fit the website layout.
* Styling the website to accurately represent the layout of the webpage using only vanilla CSS.
* Ensuring the website is responsive using a mobile-first approach.
* Pushing the code to GitHub.
