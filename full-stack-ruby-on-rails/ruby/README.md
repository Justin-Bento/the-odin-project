# Ruby Scripts

This collection includes different scripts that I use to monitor my progress as I learn Ruby programming.

### Name Modification

Is an interactive program that allows a user to input their name and select a casing option from a predefined list. After entering their name, the program prompts the user to choose a casing style, such as lowercase, UPPERCASE, camelCase, snake_case, or kebab-case. The selected casing style is then applied to the user's name, and the modified name is displayed as output.

### Budget Calulator

Calulate my after-tax income using the 50/30/20 budget rule in personal finance to help me automatically allocate my finance, without having to go online. My goal for this application is to learn Ruby's input and output, and how logic operators work inside Ruby.

### Music Key Generator

The purpose of this script is to aid me during practice by providing spontaneous key suggestions. By outputting a desired musical scale, the script ensures that the randomly selected key is appropriate and aligns with the a musical context. This functionality is useful for creating variety in practice routines, and explore different environments.
