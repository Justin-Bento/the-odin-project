# Objective: create the cipher shift encryption and shift your message around.
# Purpose: help solidify your knowledge and get warmed up to working on small projects.

# Pseudo Code:
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Take a message from someone and change each letter to be a certain number of steps down the alphabet.
# When you get the message back, you shift each letter back by the same number of steps.
# For instance, if you shift each letter by 3, 'D' would turn into 'A', 'E' would become 'B', and so on."

def caesar_cipher()
  # Define a string representing the alphabet
  #alphabet = ("a".."z").to_a.join + ("A".."Z").to_a.join
end
