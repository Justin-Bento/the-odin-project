# Objective: create the cipher shift encryption and shift your message around.
# Purpose: help solidify your knowledge and get warmed up to working on small projects.

# Pseudo Code:
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Grab plaintext from the user and replace it with a fixed number of positions down the alphabet.
# When the plaintext is grabbed from the encrypted text, it will shift by the proposed number.
# For example, in the case of 3, 'D' would be replaced by 'A', 'E' would become 'B', and so on.

def caesar_cipher(content, number)
  # Define a string representing the alphabet
  #alphabet = ("a".."z").to_a.join + ("A".."Z").to_a.join
end
